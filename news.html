  <h2> Talk 3: Geometric Patterns from Positive Integers.  </h2>
  <p class="author-date"> 23rd May, 2025</p>
  <br/>

  <br/>

    <p style="text-align: justify";> 
        GHAIDEMS and AMI Ghana present the third IDM 2025 Webinar Series to celebrate the International Day of Mathematics (IDM 2025).
    </p>
    
    <br/>

    <p style="text-align: justify";>
      GHAIDEMS and AMI Ghana invite you to a fascinating exploration of how numbers take shape in the world of geometry—where mathematics meets visual beauty.</p>

    <br/>

    <p style="text-align: justify";>
      In this engaging journey, we delve into how simple integers can be transformed into stunning geometric arrangements—squares, triangles, hexagons, stars, and more—revealing patterns that are as artistic as they are logical.
This event celebrates the harmony between form and function, showing how mathematics is not only a language of precision but also a canvas for creativity.</p>

    <br/>

    <p style="text-align: justify";>
      Any positive integer can be visually represented by a geometric arrangement of items. For example, 
      square numbers can be represented by a square grid of items. Other geometric arrangements can be created such as triangles, hexagons, and stars. 
      We'll explore some of the relationships among numbers that can create interesting geometric patterns.</p>

    <br />
    
    <h4> About the Speaker </h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify";>
      David Reimann shares his lifelong love of mathematics through his award-winning visual art. 
      Mathematical elements such as symmetry, geometry, and number are common themes in his work, used to create patterns that convey messages on multiple levels and scales. 
      His piece Pi exemplifies this by celebrating the mathematical constant pi, its relationship with the circle, and the infinitely many digits in its decimal representation.


      He provided original cover art for Mathematics Magazine, a publication of the Mathematical Association of America, 
      from 2015 through 2020. Reimann has bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics and a doctoral degree in computer science. 
      He is a Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at Albion College. Prior to joining the faculty of Albion College in 1996,
      he spent ten years as a medical imaging researcher at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.

      exploring the intersection of mathematics and art—where abstract ideas come alive through form, pattern, and beauty.</p>

    <br/>

    <p style="text-align: justify";>
      This series reflects their shared commitment to showcasing how mathematics is not only a tool for analysis but also a powerful medium for creative expression.
      By transforming numbers and equations into visual experiences, we uncover a new way to see and feel the elegance of mathematical thought.</p>

    <br/>

    <p style="text-align: justify";>
      Join us for an immersive journey into the world of mathematical art. 
      Whether you're a curious learner, a passionate educator, or someone who finds wonder in the blend of logic and creativity, 
      this event invites you to explore the hidden aesthetics of mathematics.

Discover how mathematical thinking can inspire artistic exploration, nurture imagination, 
and reveal the deep connections between logic, beauty, and human experience.</p>

    <br />
    
    <h4> About the Speaker </h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify";>
      Prof. Edmund O. Harriss is a British mathematician, artist, and educator who blends art with cutting-edge geometry. 
      His work explores tiling patterns, fractal spirals (like the Harriss Spiral), and the plastic ratio. 
      Creator of curvahedra sculptures (studied at MIT for architectural applications) and co-artist behind the Mathemalchemy project.


      He is Known for demystifying math on Numberphile and crafting public art to visualize abstract concepts. 
      He is also a visionary in bridging STEM and art.
